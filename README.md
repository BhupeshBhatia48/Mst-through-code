Created an algorithm using primâ€™s algorithm and Priority queue for
measuring minimum distance of towers.
Implemented the solution to design network systems by minimizing
the total cable length required to connect communication towers.
Leveraged the heapq library to manage dynamic edge selection for
reduced time complexity O(ElogV), improving the performance for
larger networks.
